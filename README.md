# CSES
Solving algorithmic problems from the [CSES](https://cses.fi/problemset/) (Java / C++).

Solutions are grouped by thematic sections.

The solution to each problem is located in the corresponding `Main.java` class file in an empty package (these are the resource requirements for a Java solution of tasks).

Some problems were solved using C++ (due to problems with TLE in Java implementation). The solution to such problems is in the file `main.cpp`.
